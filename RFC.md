## RFC Metadata

- **RFC ID:** (leave blank; assigned by maintainers)

## 1. Summary

Provide a concise summary of the proposed change.

- What is being changed?
- Why is the change needed?
- Is the change normative or non-normative?

This section should be understandable without reading the full document.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Describe the problem or limitation being addressed.

- What ambiguity, gap, or constraint exists today?
- Who is affected?
- Under what conditions does the issue arise?

Reference specific ANS sections where applicable.

---

## 3. Proposed Change

Describe the proposed solution in detail.

- New definitions, rules, or clarifications
- Modified behavior or constraints
- New optional or extensible mechanisms

Clearly distinguish:
- **Normative requirements**
- **Non-normative guidance or examples**

---

## 4. Normative Language (If Applicable)

If this proposal introduces or modifies normative behavior, include candidate language using RFC-style terms:

- MUST / SHALL
- SHOULD
- MAY
- MUST NOT / SHALL NOT

Draft language should be precise and unambiguous.

---

## 5. Backward Compatibility

Analyze compatibility impact:

- Is this change backward compatible?
- If not, why is the break justified?
- Are migration or coexistence paths available?

Backward compatibility is strongly preferred.

---

## 6. Interoperability Impact

Explain how the proposal affects:

- Multiple independent implementations
- Federation across Nodes, Resolvers, and Registrars
- Cross-version interaction

Proposals that reduce interoperability must be clearly justified.

---

## 7. Alternatives Considered

List reasonable alternatives and explain why they were not chosen.

This demonstrates due diligence and strengthens review.

---

## 8. Security, Trust, and Provenance Considerations

Describe any implications for:

- Trust validation
- Provenance signaling
- Misuse or abuse scenarios
- Attack surface expansion or reduction

If none, explicitly state so.

---

## 9. Implementation Considerations (Non-Normative)

Optional section for:

- Reference implementation notes
- Validation or testing considerations
- Performance or operational observations

This section MUST NOT introduce requirements.

---

## 10. Open Questions

List unresolved questions or areas needing further discussion.

---

## 11. Conclusion

Summarize the expected benefit to the AgentNet ecosystem and why this change improves the standard.

## Appendix (Optional)

- Diagrams
- Examples
- Extended discussion
