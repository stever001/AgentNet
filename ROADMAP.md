# AgentNet Roadmap

This document outlines the **public roadmap** for AgentNet.

AgentNet is a **standards-driven, federated architecture**, not a single product or platform. Accordingly, this roadmap focuses on **standards maturity, ecosystem readiness, and reference infrastructure** rather than feature velocity.

Dates are indicative. Progress is measured by **stability, interoperability, and adoption**, not speed.

---

## Roadmap Principles

The AgentNet roadmap is guided by the following principles:

- **Standards before scale**
- **Interoperability over optimization**
- **Federation over centralization**
- **Transparency over acceleration**
- **Durability over novelty**

AgentNet will evolve deliberately to avoid fragmentation or premature lock-in.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundations (Completed)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

This phase established the core conceptual and normative foundation.

### Achievements
- ANS Core v2.0 finalized and published
- Core terminology and architecture stabilized
- Governance framework defined
- Reference resolver implemented and validated
- Capsule structure and provenance model verified
- Initial documentation and examples published

This phase establishes AgentNet as a **credible, reviewable standard**.

---

## Phase 1 — Early Adoption Enablement

**Status:** 🟡 In Progress

Focus: making AgentNet **understandable, testable, and adoptable** by early stakeholders.

### Objectives
- Improve onboarding clarity for developers and architects
- Reduce ambiguity in implementation interpretation
- Enable controlled experimentation without standard drift

### Planned Work
- Expanded documentation (`docs/`)
- Additional example Capsules and workflows
- Reference validation tooling
- Resolver behavior clarifications (non-normative)
- Contributor onboarding refinement
- Public discussions and feedback channels

This phase prioritizes **clarity over coverage**.

---

## Phase 2 — Ecosystem Expansion

**Status:** ⏳ Planned

Focus: enabling multiple independent actors to participate without coordination bottlenecks.

### Objectives
- Demonstrate multi-party federation
- Encourage independent implementations
- Validate resolver interoperability

### Planned Work
- Additional reference implementations
- Cross-resolver compatibility testing
- Registry and namespace stewardship guidance
- Extension patterns and optional capabilities
- Formalized RFC workflow for standards evolution

This phase validates that AgentNet functions as a **network**, not a silo.

---

## Phase 3 — Production Readiness

**Status:** ⏳ Planned

Focus: enabling production use by enterprises, platforms, and institutions.

### Objectives
- Reduce adoption risk
- Increase predictability and trust
- Support long-term maintenance

### Planned Work
- Stability guarantees and versioning policy refinements
- Conformance and compliance guidance
- Security and threat modeling documentation
- Operational best practices (non-normative)
- Long-term governance seat population (if appropriate)

This phase emphasizes **reliability and longevity**.

---

## Phase 4 — Standards Stewardship & Evolution

**Status:** ⏳ Future

Focus: sustainable stewardship of the AgentNet Standards.

### Objectives
- Ensure neutrality and non-capture
- Support multi-stakeholder governance
- Enable responsible evolution of ANS

### Planned Work
- Formal steward appointment process
- Periodic standards review cadence
- Extension registries (if required)
- Alignment with adjacent standards bodies
- Long-term archival and provenance guarantees

This phase ensures AgentNet remains viable **decades**, not quarters.

---

## Non-Goals

The following are **explicitly out of scope** for the AgentNet roadmap:

- Operating a centralized resolver monopoly
- Mandating specific vendors or implementations
- Enforcing commercial terms or pricing
- Acting as a data broker or marketplace
- Replacing existing web standards

AgentNet is an **enabling layer**, not a gatekeeper.

---

## Measuring Progress

Progress is measured by:

- Independent implementations
- Cross-party interoperability
- Clarity and precision of the standards
- Adoption without coercion
- Stability across versions

Adoption without trust is failure.  
Trust without adoption is stagnation.

AgentNet aims for both.

---

## Final Note

This roadmap is intentionally conservative.

AgentNet’s success depends not on rapid expansion, but on becoming **boringly reliable infrastructure** for machine-readable truth.
