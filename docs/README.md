in the `/standards` directory are authoritative.

Nothing in this directory modifies, overrides, or defines conformance
requirements.

## Organization

Documentation in this directory may be organized by:
- Audience (e.g. developers, architects, operators)
- Topic (e.g. architecture, governance, SDK guidance)
- Vertical or domain (e.g. creative, healthcare)

Structure may evolve over time without affecting the standards.
