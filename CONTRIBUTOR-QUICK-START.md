# Contributor Quick Start

This quick start is for contributors who want to engage with AgentNet efficiently and responsibly.

AgentNet is a **standards-first, federated architecture**. Contributions are welcome, but precision and alignment matter more than speed.

---

## Step 1: Understand the Scope

Before contributing, you should be familiar with:

- `README.md` — project intent and structure
- `standards/ANS-Core-v2.0.docx` — authoritative specification
- `GOVERNANCE.md` — how decisions are made
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — full contribution rules

If you have not read ANS Core v2.0, **do not propose standards changes yet**.

---

## Step 2: Decide What You’re Contributing

Common contribution types:

- **Standards clarification or correction**
- **Proposed extension or optional capability**
- **Documentation improvement**
- **Example Capsule or workflow**
- **Governance or process refinement (non-normative)**

If your change affects **normative behavior**, it is a **Standards Proposal**.

---

## Step 3: Open an Issue First

Before writing code or text, open an issue describing:

- The problem or ambiguity
- Relevant ANS sections
- Why the change is needed
- Whether it is normative or non-normative

Early alignment saves time.

---

## Step 4: Use the Right Template

- Documentation or examples → direct Pull Request
- Standards changes → use `RFC.md` template
- Editorial fixes → small PR, clearly scoped

Large or controversial changes may require iteration.

---

## Step 5: Submit a Pull Request

Your PR should:

- Be focused and minimal
- Reference the related issue
- Preserve ANS terminology
- Avoid unrelated formatting changes

Expect review for clarity, interoperability impact, and standards alignment.

---

## What Success Looks Like

A successful contribution:
- Improves clarity or interoperability
- Does not privilege a specific implementation
- Can be adopted by multiple independent parties
- Preserves backward compatibility (or justifies breaking it)

---

## Final Reminder

AgentNet prioritizes **durable correctness over velocity**.

Thoughtful contributions are valued more than fast ones.
