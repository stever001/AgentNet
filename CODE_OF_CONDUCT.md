# AgentNet Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This Code of Conduct establishes the expectations for behavior and interaction within the **AgentNet** community.

AgentNet is a **standards-driven, federated ecosystem**. Productive collaboration requires professionalism, precision, and mutual respect—particularly where technical disagreement is expected and encouraged.

This document applies to all participation in AgentNet-related spaces, including repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, and governance forums.

---

## Core Principles

All participants are expected to adhere to the following principles:

- **Professionalism:** Engage with others in a manner consistent with serious technical and standards work.
- **Respect:** Treat all participants with respect, regardless of background, affiliation, or viewpoint.
- **Constructive Discourse:** Critique ideas and proposals, not individuals.
- **Good Faith:** Assume good intent unless there is clear evidence otherwise.
- **Precision:** Communicate clearly, accurately, and without unnecessary provocation.

---

## Expected Behavior

Examples of acceptable behavior include:

- Using clear, technical language when discussing proposals or issues
- Providing evidence-based arguments and reasoned critique
- Asking clarifying questions before challenging assumptions
- Respecting differing perspectives and implementation approaches
- Acknowledging errors and correcting them openly
- Staying within the defined scope of discussions

Disagreement is not only allowed—it is expected.  
However, disagreement must remain **technical, specific, and respectful**.

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not acceptable within the AgentNet community:

- Personal attacks, insults, or harassment
- Dismissive or derogatory comments toward individuals or groups
- Threats, intimidation, or coercive behavior
- Disruptive behavior that derails productive discussion
- Repeatedly ignoring governance or contribution processes
- Introducing inflammatory or non-technical rhetoric into standards discussions
- Misrepresenting others’ positions or intent

AgentNet is not a venue for ideological disputes, commercial promotion, or personal grievance.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- All public and private AgentNet repositories
- Issues, pull requests, and code reviews
- GitHub Discussions or equivalent forums
- Governance and standards review processes
- Any official AgentNet communication channels

---

## Enforcement

Enforcement of this Code of Conduct is guided by the principles of:

- **Proportionality**
- **Transparency**
- **Fairness**

Potential responses to violations may include:

- Informal clarification or warning
- Request for corrective action
- Temporary restriction of participation
- Removal from specific discussions or processes
- Permanent exclusion in cases of repeated or severe misconduct

Enforcement actions are taken to protect the integrity of the community and the standards process—not to punish disagreement.

---

## Reporting Concerns

If you experience or observe behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

- Report the concern privately to the maintainers or governance contacts listed in the repository
- Provide as much relevant context as possible
- Reports will be reviewed discreetly and in good faith

Retaliation against individuals who raise concerns in good faith is not tolerated.

---

## Relationship to Governance

This Code of Conduct operates alongside:

- `GOVERNANCE.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Behavioral concerns are handled independently of technical merit.  
A technically valid proposal may still be rejected if conduct expectations are violated.

---

## Final Statement

AgentNet exists to support **trustworthy, interoperable machine-to-machine communication at global scale**.

That goal depends as much on **how we work together** as on what we build.

Professional, respectful conduct is a shared responsibility.
