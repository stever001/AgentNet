# AgentNet Governance

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the governance model for **AgentNet**, as a federated standards ecosystem governed by the **AgentNet Standards (ANS)**.

Governance exists to:
- Preserve the integrity, neutrality, and interoperability of ANS
- Ensure transparent, auditable evolution of normative specifications
- Prevent capture of the standard by any single Node, Resolver, Registrar, or operator
- Provide predictable processes for standards change and clarification

This document is **normative only with respect to governance of ANS**. It does not impose operational or commercial requirements on participants.

---

## 2. Governance Principles (ANS-Aligned)

AgentNet governance SHALL adhere to the following principles, consistent with ANS Core v2.0:

- **Federation:** No centralized authority is required for global participation.
- **Neutrality:** Governance SHALL NOT privilege any specific implementation, operator, or vendor.
- **Interoperability First:** Changes MUST prioritize cross-implementation compatibility.
- **Transparency:** Governance actions MUST be publicly documented.
- **Minimalism:** Governance exists to protect the standard, not to manage the ecosystem.
- **Non-Requirement:** Participation in AgentNet SHALL NOT require governance approval.

---

## 3. Scope of Governance Authority

Governance authority is strictly limited to:

- The AgentNet Standards (ANS)
- Normative definitions, terminology, and compliance rules
- Versioning, deprecation, and backward-compatibility policy
- Interpretation of ANS Core requirements
- Stewardship of shared namespaces defined by ANS (if any)

Governance explicitly DOES NOT extend to:

- Operation of Nodes
- Operation of Resolvers
- Operation of Registrars
- Commercial terms, pricing, or interchange
- Enforcement beyond standards conformance claims

---

## 4. Governance Bodies (Defined Roles)

The following governance roles are **defined by the standard**. Population of these roles MAY occur incrementally.

### 4.1 Standards Stewards

**Function:**  
Custodians of the AgentNet Standards (ANS).

**Responsibilities:**
- Approve, reject, or defer proposed changes to ANS
- Ensure internal consistency across ANS sections and appendices
- Enforce backward-compatibility guarantees
- Author and publish normative clarifications when ambiguity exists

**Authority:**  
Final authority over publication of ANS versions.

---

### 4.2 Technical Advisory Group (TAG)

**Function:**  
Non-authoritative technical advisory body.

**Responsibilities:**
- Evaluate proposed extensions or interpretations
- Identify interoperability or implementation risks
- Review reference implementations for alignment (non-binding)
- Provide non-normative guidance to Standards Stewards

The TAG SHALL NOT possess approval authority over ANS.

---

### 4.3 Governance Chair (Optional)

**Function:**  
Procedural facilitator.

**Responsibilities:**
- Ensure governance processes are followed
- Coordinate publication of decisions and disclosures
- Resolve procedural disputes without altering technical outcomes

The Governance Chair SHALL NOT introduce technical requirements.

---

## 5. Bootstrap Governance Phase

AgentNet is currently operating under a **bootstrap governance phase**, consistent with ANS Core v2.0.

During this phase:
- Governance roles MAY be unfilled or temporarily consolidated
- Standards changes MAY be initiated by the project originator
- All decisions MUST be documented publicly
- No irreversible governance constraints SHALL be imposed

The bootstrap phase exists to enable early adoption while preserving future neutrality.

---

## 6. Standards Change Process

### 6.1 Normal Changes

A standards change SHALL follow this process:

1. Proposal is documented (issue, RFC, or equivalent)
2. Normative vs non-normative impact is identified
3. Compatibility impact is assessed
4. Decision is recorded publicly
5. Change is versioned according to ANS rules

---

### 6.2 Emergency Changes

Emergency changes are permitted **only to protect ecosystem integrity or prevent material harm**.

Emergency changes:
- MUST be narrowly scoped
- MUST be publicly disclosed post-hoc
- MUST undergo subsequent formal review
- SHALL NOT create permanent obligations without review

---

## 7. Transparency Requirements

The following records MUST be publicly accessible:

- Published ANS versions
- Change logs and release notes
- Governance decisions and rationales
- Emergency change disclosures
- Deprecation notices

Opaque or private governance decision-making is prohibited.

---

## 8. Neutrality and Non-Capture Guarantees

AgentNet governance SHALL NOT:

- Require use of any specific Resolver or Registrar
- Grant exclusive rights or privileges
- Condition participation on fees or membership
- Enforce commercial terms
- Establish closed or informal decision channels

ANS compliance is a **self-asserted claim**, subject only to public scrutiny.

---

## 9. Evolution of Governance

This governance document MAY evolve over time.

Any governance change:
- MUST be publicly documented
- MUST NOT retroactively invalidate compliant implementations
- MUST preserve federated participation
- SHOULD align with existing ANS terminology and structure

Formal population of governance roles SHOULD occur only when:
- Multiple independent stakeholders are active
- Cross-implementation adoption is demonstrated
- Shared stewardship improves standard stability

---

## 10. Final Statement

AgentNet governance exists solely to **protect the AgentNet Standards**.

It does not control participation, operation, or innovation.

Its legitimacy derives from:
- Transparency
- Technical rigor
- Voluntary adoption
- Long-term interoperability
